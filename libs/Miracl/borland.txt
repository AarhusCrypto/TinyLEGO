You have just downloaded the "free" and excellent Borland Compiler from 
www.borland.com, and you want to compile the MIRACL library and create some 
applications. If so, read on....

If you have the TASM assembler (which is not free) then unzip all the MIRACL 
files into one directory, read the comments at the start of bc32doit.bat
and if happy execute the batch file. Some example commands to build some 
representative applications are at the end of the batch file.

If you don't have TASM then you can still build a C-only library (which will 
be slower). Proceed as follows..

1. Unzip MIRACL into a single directory - do not tick the Use Folder Names
   box if using WinZip

2. Use this header for mirdef.h. Note that Borland now supports a 64-bit data 
   type called __int64 (compatible with Microsoft C)

#define MIRACL 32
#define MR_LITTLE_ENDIAN
#define mr_utype int
#define MR_IBITS 32
#define MR_LBITS 32
#define mr_unsign32 unsigned int
#define mr_dltype __int64
#define mr_unsign64 unsigned __int64
#define MR_NOASM
#define MR_FLASH 52
#define MAXBASE ((mr_small)1<<(MIRACL-1))


3. Copy all the miracl header files into the directory where Borland C
   puts its standard headers. This may be c:\borland\bcc55\include

4. Edit bc32doit.bat. Read the comments at the start. Remove all -B compiler 
   flags (these invoke TASM, and you haven't got TASM). 
   Delete all references to mrmuldv.c

5. Run the batch file.
